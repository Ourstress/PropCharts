#### Description
Our site provides up-to-date visual information about Singapore's property market.

### Sources

### Assumptions

#### Quarterly data to monthly data

- We approximate Q1's data value as January's data value, Q2 as Apr, Q3 as Jul and Q4 as Oct. 
Question: Isn't this method of converting Quarterly data to Monthly data inaccurate?
- Yes, both the approximated monthly value and curve isn't pinpoint accurate. You should only be relying on the data to get ***an idea of the general trend***.
